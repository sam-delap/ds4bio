    "## Question 1: Is there a relationship between quarterback fantasy points scored and team defense fantasy points scored on the same team?\n",
    "In other words, does a quarterback who scores more fantasy points (and presumably more real NFL points for his team) have any effect on how their team's defense performs?\n",
    "- **What is your hypothesis?**: I hypothesize that quarterback fantasy football scoring will have no effect on team defense fantasy point scoring. The quarterback plays on the offensive side of the ball, and so how the QB performs should not statistically influence how his defense performs, since they are not on the football field at the same time (teams take turns switching off playing offense/defense)\n",
    "- **How does this relate to the researcher's question?**: This question is related to the researcher's question because they were trying to use a model to predict the number of fantasy points a quarterback/team defense might score. If quarterback fantasy point scoring was a strong predictor of team defensive scoring (or vice versa), the researchers could've added this to their model.\n",
    "- **How does this relate to Part 1?**: This question is a more specific form of the research question I asked in part 1. I'm examining this question for quarterbacks/team defenses from the same team.\n",
    "- **Why use this data?**: This data provides information about the team QBs/DSTs belonged to, as well as how many fantasy points they scored for each week of the NFL season.\n",
    "- **Which features will you be using?**: I will be using `fantasy points scored`, `team`, and `player` to complete this assignment\n",
    "- **How many observations are there for each feature?**: There are the same number of observations for each feature, which is 15 * the number of players at that position.\n",
    "    - For QBs: 585\n",
    "    - For DSTs: 480\n",
    "    - Since the reason there are more quarterbacks is because some teams played multiple quarterbacks, I will simplify this analysis by combining the QBs that played for an individual team and treating them as if they were 1 QB"

    "- **What conclusions can we make about the research question based on the model results?**: DST scoring is predictive of QB scoring, and should be added to the authors' model to help improve their projections. One way this could be done is by keeping track of how many points a team defense scores, on average, and using this linear model to add a flat amount of points to the QB projection for that team.\n",
    "- **Explain the model in everyday language**: If the DST scored 0 points, we can expect the QB to have scored, on average, 12.97 fantasy points (the equivalent of 325 passing yards and 0 touchdowns, or 175 yards and 1 touchdown). For every fantasy point that the team's DST scores, the QB's fantasy points scored increases by 0.133"

    "- **What conclusions can we make about the research question based on the model results?**: Week of the NFL season is not predictive of QB scoring, and should be kept out of the authors' model.\n",
    "- **Explain the model in everyday language**: During week 1 (the first week for which we would have data), QBs are predicted to score 13.4 fantasy points (335 yards, 0 TDs or 185 yards, 1 TD). For each subsequent week of the NFL season QBs will score, on average, 0.12 fantasy points less."

We are still not confident (though somehow we are closer to confident) that there is a significant, linear relationship between week of the NFL season and QB scoring.\n",
    "- **What conclusions can we make about the research question based on the model results?**: Week of the NFL season is not predictive of QB scoring, and should be kept out of the authors' model. It will also skew other elements of the authors' model if it is included, so it is important that it be kept out.\n",
    "- **Explain the model in everyday language**: For every point that the team's DST scores, the QB's fantasy points scored increases by 0.136. For every week of the NFL season (as it gets later in the season), team defensive scoring decreases by 0.123 fantasy points."

    "- **What can we conclude about the parameters of the model?**: QB fantasy point projections are more predictive of QB fantasy point scoring than DST fantasy point scoring (and/or they co-vary).\n",
    "- **How certain/uncertain are we about them?**: Based on the probability from the t-test (P > |t|), we are 100% confident that there is a significant, linear relationship between QB projections and QB scoring. We are not as confident that there is a significant, linear relationship between DST scoring and QB scoring.\n",
    "- **What conclusions can we make about the research question based on the model results?**: The authors' projection model performs well, outperforming the single best predictor that we found in our own study. It is possible that DST scoring is already a part of their model. We also learn that the authors' projections, on average, overestimate the scoring output of the QB position.\n",
    "- **Explain the model in everyday language**: For every point that the team's DST scores, the QB's fantasy points scored increases by 0.03 (the equivalent of 1 passing yard). In contrast, for every point a quarterback is projected to score, they typically score 0.91 of those points."

    "## Question 2: Do more top-8 quarterback/DST weekly finishes result in a higher average fantasy points scored?\n",
    "- **What is your hypothesis?**: I hypothesize that there will be a linear relationship, but it will not be very strong. Week-to-week scoring at the quarterback position is highly variable, so I would expect that most quarterbacks will have high highs and low lows. In other words, most QBs will finish similarly in terms of how many top-8 finishes they have, but the rest of their weeks will be much lower-scoring for fantasy.\n",
    "- **How does this relate to the researcher's question?**: This question is more relevant for fantasy football managers, because in a typical 12-team fantasy league there are only 12 quarterbacks in fantasy starting lineups each week. Knowing that a wide (or narrow) % of QBs will finish with at least one top-8 week (a fantasy-relevant week) allows players to make informed decisions about how to value the QB position (is it replaceable? will lots of quarterbacks score well at least once? Then it should be valued below more scarce positions. Otherwise, it should be highly valued.)\n",
    "- **How does this relate to Part 1?**: This is asking a similar style of question, where the goal is to gain insight into what factors produce consistent, high-scoring fantasy football players\n",
    "- **Why use this data?**: This data provides information about the how many fantasy points QBs scored every week\n",
    "- **Which features will you be using?**: I will be using `fantasy points scored` and `player` to answer this question\n",
    "- **How many observations are there for each feature?**: There are the same number of observations for each feature, which is 15 * the number of players at the QB position (585)"

    "- **What conclusions can we make about the research question based on the model results?**: DSTs with more top-8 weeks tend to have a higher average scoring. If a DST scores highly in 1 or 2 weeks, it's more likely that the team will continue to score highly.\n",
    "- **Explain the model in everyday language**: A DST with 0 finishes in the top-8 DSTs will average 6.0 fantasy points (the equivalent of allowing 14-20 points, sacking the QB 2 times, and forcing a fumble). For each top-8 DST peformance, the DST's average fantasy points scored increases by 1.3 fantasy points (the equivalent of allowing 3 less points, sacking the QB 1 more time, or catching an interception)."
